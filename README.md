# *`Flint.`* â€“ Freelancing Web Application

*`Flint.`* is a full-featured freelancing web application that I have built using the **`MERN Stack`** as a part of my SWE course group project. Developed primarily with focus on the **backend architecture**, APIs, database schema design, and authentication workflows, 
this platform provides a seamless experience for freelancers and clients to interact, manage orders, process payments, and communicate in real-time.
